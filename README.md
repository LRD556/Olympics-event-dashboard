# Olympics-event-analysis
This project required me to create test data to perform analysis on an upcoming sport event that will be streamed via the web.
The random, csv and datetime libraries were used to create the test data and an Exploratory data analysis was carried out.
The findings were shown using simple matplotlib visualizations.
